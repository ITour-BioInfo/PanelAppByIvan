# Panel text files

Panel files in this folder are simple text files so they are easy to view and edit directly on GitHub.

- One gene symbol per line.
- Optional metadata header lines start with `# key: value` at the top.
- Blank lines and other comment lines that start with `#` are allowed.
- Keep the list sorted to make diffs easy to read.

## Downloading a panel
1. Open the file in the GitHub repository view.
2. Use the **Download raw file** button to save the `.txt` locally.

## Proposing edits with GitHub’s web UI
1. Open the panel file you want to change.
2. Click the **Edit this file** pencil button.
3. Make your edits (metadata lines first, then one gene per line).
4. Add a commit message and choose **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
5. Submit the pull request for review.
